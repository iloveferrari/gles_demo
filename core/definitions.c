/*<h2>atmosphere/definitions.glsl</h2>

<p>This GLSL file defines the physical types and constants which are used in the
main <a href="functions.glsl.html">functions</a> of our atmosphere model, in
such a way that they can be compiled by a GLSL compiler (a
<a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file
provides the same types and constants in C++, to allow the same functions to be
compiled by a C++ compiler - see the <a href="../index.html">Introduction</a>).

<h3>Physical quantities</h3>

<p>The physical quantities we need for our atmosphere model are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometry">radiometric</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(optics)">photometric</a>
quantities. In GLSL we can't define custom numeric types to enforce the
homogeneity of expressions at compile time, so we define all the physical
quantities as <code>float</code>, with preprocessor macros (there is no
<code>typedef</code> in GLSL).

<p>We start with six base quantities: length, wavelength, angle, solid angle,
power and luminous power (wavelength is also a length, but we distinguish the
two for increased clarity).
*/

#define Length float
#define Wavelength float
#define Angle float
#define SolidAngle float
#define Power float
#define LuminousPower float

/*
<p>From this we "derive" the irradiance, radiance, spectral irradiance,
spectral radiance, luminance, etc, as well pure numbers, area, volume, etc (the
actual derivation is done in the <a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++
equivalent</a> of this file).
*/

#define Number float
#define Area float
#define Volume float
#define NumberDensity float
#define Irradiance float
#define Radiance float
#define SpectralPower float
#define SpectralIrradiance float
#define SpectralRadiance float
#define SpectralRadianceDensity float
#define ScatteringCoefficient float
#define InverseSolidAngle float
#define LuminousIntensity float
#define Luminance float
#define Illuminance float

/*
<p>We  also need vectors of physical quantities, mostly to represent functions
depending on the wavelength. In this case the vector elements correspond to
values of a function at some predefined wavelengths. Again, in GLSL we can't
define custom vector types to enforce the homogeneity of expressions at compile
time, so we define these vector types as <code>vec3</code>, with preprocessor
macros. The full definitions are given in the
<a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file).
*/

// A generic function from Wavelength to some other type.
#define AbstractSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to Number.
#define DimensionlessSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to SpectralPower.
#define PowerSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to SpectralIrradiance.
#define IrradianceSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to SpectralRadiance.
#define RadianceSpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to SpectralRadianceDensity.
#define RadianceDensitySpectrum vec3
// A function from Wavelength to ScaterringCoefficient.

#define Luminance3 vec3
// A vector of 3 illuminance values.
#define Illuminance3 vec3

/*
<p>Finally, we also need precomputed textures containing physical quantities in
each texel. Since we can't define custom sampler types to enforce the
homogeneity of expressions at compile time in GLSL, we define these texture
types as <code>sampler2D</code> and <code>sampler3D</code>, with preprocessor
macros. The full definitions are given in the
<a href="reference/definitions.h.html">C++ equivalent</a> of this file).

<h3>Physical units</h3>

<p>We can then define the units for our six base physical quantities:
meter (m), nanometer (nm), radian (rad), steradian (sr), watt (watt) and lumen
(lm):

as well as some derived units (kilometer km, kilocandela kcd, degree deg):

    watt / (m2 * sr * nm);

<h3>Atmosphere parameters</h3>

<p>Using the above types, we can now define the parameters of our atmosphere
model:
*/

  // proportional to exp(-h / rayleigh_scale_height), with h the altitude
  // (with the bottom of the atmosphere at altitude 0).
  Length rayleigh_scale_height;
  // The scattering coefficient of air molecules at the bottom of the
  // atmosphere, as a function of wavelength.
  ScatteringSpectrum rayleigh_scattering;
  // The scale height of aerosols, meaning that their density is proportional
  // to exp(-h / mie_scale_height), with h the altitude.
  Length mie_scale_height;
  // The scattering coefficient of aerosols at the bottom of the atmosphere,
  // as a function of wavelength.
  ScatteringSpectrum mie_scattering;
  // The extinction coefficient of aerosols at the bottom of the atmosphere,
  // as a function of wavelength.
  ScatteringSpectrum mie_extinction;
  // The asymetry parameter for the Cornette-Shanks phase function for the
  // aerosols.
  Number mie_phase_function_g;
  // The average albedo of the ground.
  DimensionlessSpectrum ground_albedo;
  // The cosine of the maximum Sun zenith angle for which atmospheric scattering
  // must be precomputed (for maximum precision, use the smallest Sun zenith
  // angle yielding negligible sky light radiance values. For instance, for the
  // Earth case, 102 degrees is a good choice - yielding mu_s_min = -0.2).
  Number mu_s_min;
